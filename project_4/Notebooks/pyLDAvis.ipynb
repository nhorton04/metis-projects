       "[\"Hi there,\\n\\nI 've been looking for a stable job (freelancing rn) for the past year in a FAANG company and right now am feeling pretty down because after all the work done (basically from august 2019 til now) I still cannot get an offer.  \\nFor a bit of a background, I am a devops/sre engineer with 5 years of experience mostly in Asia in SME's. I have a master degree from a top tier engineering school in telecoms.  \\nI started to interview a year ago with Nextdoor for SF and finished a few weeks ago with Facebook for London where I screwed up in a extra coding interview.  \\nI've done not less than 14 full processes so far (mostly for London because of the visa issues for the states as I am not a US citizen):\\n\\n* Nextdoor (SF)\\n* Google (Sydney)\\n* Yelp (London)\\n* Revolut (London)\\n* Dataiku (London)\\n* ThoughtWorks (London)\\n* Cloudflare (London ) \\\\* 2\\n* Glovo (Barcelona - offer)\\n* Bulb (London)\\n* Cisco + Cisco Meraki (London)\\n* Apple (London)\\n* Facebook (London)\\n* Mastercard (London)\\n\\nSo my question is, how hard it is to get into those companies? I've done everything by the book, reading cracking the coding interview, coding on leetcode (although I feel being a devops people do not require (full) developer problems except facebook/apple), reading Tanenbaum and shit about low-level OS functionalities, refreshing my memory about TCP packets and still I cannot get in.\\n\\nDo you think the COVID is currently impacting the way tech companies are recruiting and are maybe pickier? Should I give up and go to a lower-tier tech company and retry every year of my life until I can finally make it?\\n\\nI am feeling it is especially hard for devops/sre peeps as each company has its own definition of this particular role (hence very different technical tests) and the range of knowledge is very wide, especially for midrange/senior levels.\\n\\nWhat's more, would you say big companies are more reticent to hire people from SME background as they have never seen the scale of the giant (which is precisely why I want to join a FAANG right now)?\\n\\nHappy to take any comments or insights, you can also tell me I'm just whining it's fine. I'll probably detail all the interview process soon in a leetcode post if anybody's interested as well.  \\nCheers\",\n",

       " ' Recent Lurker here. Full disclosure, I am a hardware engineer but this forum has been really useful in answering a lot of my job related questions since we both end up in very similar companies. \\n\\n**Some background:** I am a first-generation college student and pretty much had to struggle through college ‚Äì parents couldn‚Äôt afford college for me and I didn‚Äôt qualify for a lot of student loans as an international student. I mention this because it usually meant I was begging to be let into classes before drop/add periods while my parents tried to scrape together cash for the semester. Luckily, I made it through!\\n\\nRight now, I am about 3 years out of grad school. Completed my MS in Electrical Engineering at a pretty good school (Top 10 in the US) and got a decent gig right out of school ‚Äì smaller company but relatively well known in what we specialize in. Despite knowing I had potential, college was not a walk in the park for me. Looking back with what I know now‚Ä¶I was insanely underprepared *(I know, I went to a top 10 grad school but I put this down to excellent Rec letters - my undergrad advisor was a very big deal)* and ended up graduating undergrad with a 3.0 and grad school with a 2.7 GPA. Not stellar by any means.\\n\\nThe weird thing is that professors that I worked with always thought I had a lot higher GPA than I did based on my performance in research tasks and chats in office hours and this always bugged me.\\n\\nAfter getting adult money, I went to therapy (secretly ‚Äì mental health is sadly still kind of taboo in my family) since I always knew something was off ‚Äì I love what I do and was usually pretty vocal in classes but always had the hardest time focusing or completing assignments . Well, I was diagnosed with OCD and anxiety which, looking back now, had a major impact on my academics. \\n\\nAnyway, after starting my first job, I took on a lot of work to prove myself and I have completed a LOT of projects to date. My work has been sold to Fortune 50 companies, appeared on TV etc. I have gotten prizes and bonuses for outstanding performance on a couple projects. Nowadays, I am regarded at a top-tier engineer at my company and usually get to deal with a lot of the tough/high-profile designs. It‚Äôs been great on that front and I feel relieved to know that I could perform well in industry and that my GPA doesn‚Äôt define me (I struggled with this a lot). I feel like Mike from the TV show ‚ÄòSuits‚Äô. \\n\\nHowever, fast forward to a couple weeks ago ‚Äì my Linkedin profile started getting a lot of attention. A recruiter from one of the big 4 reached out to me to tell me how impressed they were with my profile and presented an opportunity in line with my area of expertise.  I am happy where I work but this is a dream company, I couldn‚Äôt turn this down!). I send over my resume and he passed it along to the hiring manager. A couple days later they come back and ask for my grad and undergrad GPA‚Ä¶‚Ä¶they definitely were not impressed *(surprise!)*. They even asked if my GPA was due to extenuating circumstances and requested transcripts ‚Äì I imagine they had a hard time reconciling all of the accomplishments on my resume with that GPA. Despite all of my experience, they decided to not move forward with the interview. I was crushed‚Ä¶\\n\\nI always thought that if I could get a few years of work and prove myself, the GPA aspect would fade away (I still get anxiety about it to this day). Their feedback was to continue working for a couple more years and return to them and I would have a better shot. I am not sure how much I believe them though. A close friend from grad school applied to this same company and got an offer a couple weeks before I applied...only difference between us is that he graduated with a 3.6 GPA..\\n\\nUgh. On one hand, I‚Äôm proud of myself for making it through with all of the obstacles that I faced but sadly, I doubt that matters to big companies and that sucks. \\n\\nI‚Äôm really torn, I am truly tempted to go back to pursue my PhD now that I have a handle on my finances and my mental health. I know that this is not the best decision financially, but I really would feel accomplished by killing it at a PhD program and getting a high GPA that I can be proud about. GPA has always been my Achilles heel  - I kid you not, I get nightmares frequently that I‚Äôm back in college and failing courses. \\n\\nAnyway, I would really love some feedback:\\n\\n**1) Is pursuing my PhD worth it in my case?**\\n\\n**2) Will it getting a PhD open more doors?** \\n\\n**3) Is working at a Big 4 a pipe dream unless I do a PhD or should I just keep racking up years of experience?**\\n\\nI know people advise against it from a financial perspective, but I hate the feeling of being trapped by my GPA. \\n\\n**TL;DR: Was rejected from Big 4 for having a low GPA, contemplating going back for PhD to boost my profile.**',\n",

       " 'I\\'m unfamiliar with a few of those, but overall, you have a list of rather picky companies, that would be picky regardless of the current state of the world.\\n\\nIf you think about all the things that can go into hiring someone, you\\'re looking at a mix of:\\n\\n1. **Can candidate code?** You say you\\'re in DevOps/SRE. I don\\'t know how much you slant toward being a the \\'dev\\' part of that (e.g. Facebook PE, Google SRE-SWE) or the \\'ops\\' side (e.g. Google SRE-SE). I\\'m going to assume you\\'ve been going for roles that have an emphasis on writing code.\\n\\n2. **Does candidate otherwise have the breadth/depth of knowledge for said role?** Like assume you\\'re going more for the systems-y/operational aspect of DevOps, they might ask a lot of questions designed to target that type of knowledge they want.\\n\\n2. **Does candidate give good behavioral answers?** This can really be a make-or-break interview (or set of questions) for candidates. Apple, for example, is rather famous for assessing candidates on their behavioral qualities. A bad behavioral round at Facebook will end your candidacy, regardless of the outcomes of the technical rounds.\\n\\n3. **Does candidate have strong technicals and fundamental understanding?** We can assess this many ways, like via a system design at Facebook, or maybe something like a project retrospective/deep dive.\\n\\n4. **Does candidate fit the expectations of the role?** And by this, I mean are you, say \\'senior level\\' or \\'principal level\\' or whatever, depending on what role you\\'re going for or that they are targeting you for. Some companies like Google and Facebook don\\'t have you applying for specific levels, but they make that assessment based on your total interview assessment. \\n\\n   I interview a lot of candidates (at Facebook), mostly coding and system design. Coding expectations for IC software engineers at FB are pretty much the same from entry-level to senior/staff-level. However, system design interviews scale up in expectations when you\\'re talking about someone who\\'s a mid-level vs. someone who\\'s a senior vs. someone who\\'s staff, etc. It\\'s not uncommon to see people who do well on the coding, but can\\'t design and talk about systems at the level they\\'re targeted for. Similarly, the behaviors of someone that has a lot of experience should be dramatically different compared to someone in the first year or two of their career.\\n\\n   In some cases, you might get down-leveled from your expectations if you did well overall, whereas in other cases, you\\'d just get rejected.\\n\\n5. **Would I want to work with candidate?** This is, obviously, super subjective, emotional, and can be pretty biased, but interviewers are really thinking about this, whether they are conscious of it or not. Some companies try to have a process that minimizes this bias (like Google or Facebook\\'s hiring committees) but you shouldn\\'t be surprised to hear that there are environments where someone just says \"I didn\\'t like the interviewee\" or \"I would never work on a team with this person\" and that could really just end your candidacy.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nAt this stage, since you\\'ve done 14 full loops, it means you clearly have a profile that at least gets you in the door. But the full loops is where everything gets really hazy, especially if you can\\'t identify (or don\\'t have the ability to properly assess) where you may have tripped up or where you may have been weak.\\n\\nSo when thinking about all that, I\\'d say it\\'s too simplistic to say you did things \\'by the book\\', because the books don\\'t capture all sorts of things that go into interviewing and the decision-making process, and it certainly can\\'t account for human factors or even just plain-old luck. Maybe you do well on coding but just didn\\'t operate at the level needed for the roles you\\'re going for, maybe you communicated poorly, maybe you got super harsh interviewers, who knows.\\n\\nAlso, I am not a lawyer and I\\'m not sure how this works for non-EU people who don\\'t live in the EU but are interviewing for places with a presence in the EU, but the GDPR does allow you to request your interview feedback from companies if they are some form of digital record (e.g. typed into a web app and saved in a database counts).\\n\\n\\n> What\\'s more, would you say big companies are more reticent to hire people from SME background as they have never seen the scale of the giant (which is precisely why I want to join a FAANG right now)?\\n\\nNo, I\\'d say that these companies (especially the ones you listed) are a lot more welcoming of people who come from very diverse work histories. I interview people who come from companies ranging from small 10-person startups up to those coming from similar companies like Google or Uber, and everything in between.',\n",

I think the thing to really take out of any of these materials is that you should know how to structure your approach when working through the problem and your design. You should be asking _good_ questions, get a design that addresses at least the basic requirements, and then go on from there. You should also be trying to drive your decisions and design from a mix of your actual experiences coupled with building off that knowledge, and you should be able to explain how everything actually works.  \\n  \\n  \\nFor example, for one particular design question I give, candidates typically end up saying they'd use some type of caching mechanism, but most candidates who just learn the magic phrase 'use a cache' then get stymied when I dig deeper into why they use the cache, how they'd use it, what their eviction policy would look like, what the cache usage growth and patterns could look like, etc.\\n  \\n  \\nI don't advocate for any particular resources, but I probably take least umbrage with [the Donne Martin system design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#how-to-approach-a-system-design-interview-question).\\n  \\n  \\nAnd as I've been telling people - don't get fancy in your VC whiteboarding tool. Don't fall into the trap of assuming that your design should reflect a real-world implementation, like if you were asked to, say, design Youtube.\\n\\n----\\nFor (3)\\n\\nWell, the behavioral interviewer wants to talk about things you have in your background.

I would not classify women hired at Grace Hopper as diversity hires, more like diversity recruits as another comment mentioned. Recruitment may sometimes have focus on diversity, but hiring most likely does not. It‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre hiring diverse people for the sake of it, it‚Äôs that there may be more effort to seek out diverse recruits. Whether that trickles down to affect the diversity of hiring is something I‚Äôm unsure of, but from my experience I would say it doesn‚Äôt have a large enough affect where I would classify anyone as a diversity hire (and it‚Äôs still definitely not a situation where the hiring bar was lowered for a more diverse person). As long as the interview and hiring bar is not being lowered for people based on their diversity, I see no issue.\\n\\nImo, calling anyone a diversity hire devalues their experience and efforts to get that position, because more than likely you have no idea of the actual qualities that actually got them hired. Am I a diversity hire because I interviewed at Grace Hopper even though I spend all summer preparing for recruiting season and have done research into the hiring process since high school to prepare for my career? I want to be recognize for those efforts, not because someone thinks I may have been hired because I‚Äôm a woman.\\n\\nTo further address the comment above, many many companies, big and small, attend Grace Hopper and interview there, not just Google and Facebook. If you‚Äôre saying every GHC hire is a diversity hire, you‚Äôre looking at a very large portion of woman engineers for those companies.

I read it exactly, rushed through it, stumbled quite a bit, and eventually finished.  Felt like crap for the rest of the day and couldn‚Äôt function due to the anxiety behind those 5 minutes.  My coworkers later commented that I did okay, but I remain skeptical of their opinions.\\n\\nRegarding everything else, yeah, I‚Äôm underpaid and afraid to leave my comfort zone. This job literally fell into my lap (thanks to LinkedIn) so I‚Äôve never had to job hunt before which terrifies me.  If I stay with it, I do have some background with the product, but at the same time, 0 confidence with it.  I also don‚Äôt know if that raise will ever come, but I do know my lead is actually fighting for it and maybe this could be the turning point for it ü§∑üèª\\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è\\n\\nI think I‚Äôm just way too critical of myself and psyching myself out.  I probably could do this job okay and everything will turn out all right, but the road to being all right with it scares the absolute crap out of me.  \\n\\nAnd if it doesn‚Äôt work out, job hunting seems daunting, but it‚Äôs worth a shot to start looking and applying just in case. I mean, Amazon and other big companies have reached out to me, so I guess my LinkedIn looks fairly impressive and desirable which is nice.\\n\\nAll in all, idk, your comment was really nice and thought provoking. Thank you',\n",

    "I'm noticing a lot of topics from wallstreetbets - about investment/trading terms (robinhood, \"bullish\", brokerage, volatility, etc), corporations (Uber, Boeing, Nvidia, Tesla), gambling jokes, and a lot of their raunchy/inappropriate language. I also see some topics about politicans and Hong Kong, which makes sense because r/politics is also highly represented in the data (wallstreetbets has 36,719 comments, and politics has 38,821). Interestingly, I don't see many scientific terms, even though r/science has 59,966 comments in the dataset. Maybe that's because the terms used more frequently there are less obvious, just normal words, and the \"scientific terms\" are so widely varied and more seldom used that they don't appear in topics... the words aren't as recognizable? Most of the other subreddits have lower numbers of comments overall, so it makes sense they wouldn't be represented."
